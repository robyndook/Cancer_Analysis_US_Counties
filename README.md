Data Analytics Final Project - Medically Underserved Area Index Mortality and Incidence Rate Analytics on Cancer Treatment Centers by US Counties using Medically Under Area Index (MUA), Mortality, Median Income, Population, Age, Race, and Gender
### Overview
- We will use our knowledge of Python to web-scrape dataset and create a database or all Cancer types per county in the United States, MUA Index, Median Income, Population, Age, Race, and Gender
- Using this data we will utilize Machine Learning to build a dynamic table, to answer three key questions
    - Is there a relationship between Cancer Mortality or Incidence and Medically Underserved Index per County
    - Is there a relationship between Cancer Mortality or Incidence and Demographic Data per County
    - Is there a relationship between Cancer Mortality or Incidence and Median Household Income per County
- With Tableau we will display the database to show area where Cancer Mortality and Incidence are prelevant and a dinamic visualization of the demographics we chose
- Finally we will compile our visualiztions and Machine Learning results into a web site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
    - Our webpage will highlight our skills and link directly to our Linkedin, GitHub, and direct contact

### Results
#### Machine Learning
**For Detailed Results for Regression Module please view [THIS](https://github.com/robyndook/Cancer_Treatment_Centers_California/blob/c8516c38818c61b649145c372da5ea5a9505d48c/Machine_Learning_Model/Segment_3_Models/Segment_3_Written_Report.md) page**  
We decided to stick with linear regression for our model choice because it became apparent that more advance machine learning regression techniques would be unlikely to improve model performance. For example, when we tried to use a decision tree regression, r-squared values never improved substantially, and in many cases they were actually lower than the basic linear regression. I think this was the case because more complex machine learning models typically don't improve model performance when datasets are smaller such as the ones we used in our regressions. We found it more important to spend our time optimizing the basic linear regression models by changing the regressors, editing the data preprocessing, etc.

The benefit of using linear regression is that they can produce a unique prediction for incidence/mortality rates based on a unique set of inputs. That being said, however, while linear regression was the right choice for our model selection, we were limited in that we could not create regressions that included variation in each of sex, age, and race/ethnicity since we weren't able to scrape this data. As a result, the predictive power of each regression was slightly more limited than we had hoped we could create.

In all, despite some of the challenges we faced, our models lead us to conclusive answers to each of our questions:

 1. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between cancer mortality/incidence and the medically underserved index.
 2. While gender and race certainly has an impact on cancer mortality/incidence, age is the demographic characteristic accounting for the vast majority of variety in these rates.
 3. We found the impact of median household income on cancer mortality/incidence to be minimal (essentially zero).
